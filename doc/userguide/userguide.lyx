\begin_layout Chapter
Engine Architecture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
HadesFIX
\series default
 engine architecture is based on the concept of FIX session connected to
 a counter-party.
 Each configured session will have its Session Coordinator thread started.
 It is the responsibility of the Session Coordinator to manage all the processes
 involved in the FIX session connection setup.
 There can be only two types of session:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
client session - corresponds to the FIX session initiator (buy side).
 The client session attempts to connect to a server (FIX acceptor) using
 the TCP transport and logs in and establish a session with the server.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
server session - corresponds to the FIX session acceptor (sell side).
 The server session wait for client(s) session to connect using the TCP
 transport, authenticates the client and starts a FIX session.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\series bold
HadesFIX
\series default
 instance can host multiple client or server sessions configured and running
 at one time that are connecting to the same or different counter-parties.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\series bold
HadesFIX
\series default
 instance is configured using a XML file.
 The schema of the XML configuration file can be found in the distribution's
 "config" directory - 
\emph on
HadesEngineConfig.xsd
\emph default
 file.
 The instance configuration file is a mandatory parameter in order to start
 a 
\series bold
HadesFIX
\series default
 engine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each FIX session, whether client or server, contains two Streams: a 
\emph on
Consumer Stream
\emph default
 and a 
\emph on
Producer Stream
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Client/Server Stream
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\emph on
Client/Server Session
\emph default
 has two Streams configured: a 
\emph on
Consumer Stream
\emph default
 and a 
\emph on
Producer Stream
\emph default
, each of them running in their own threads.
 The 
\emph on
Consumer Stream
\emph default
 is reading messages received from the counter-party using the connected
 FIX session and deliver these messages to the business application layer.
 The 
\emph on
Producer Stream
\emph default
 on the other side takes the messages produced by the business tier and
 send them to the counter-party using the connected FIX session

\begin_layout Section
Client/Server Flow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There can be multiple 
\emph on
Consumer Flows
\emph default
 configured for a 
\emph on
Consumer Stream
\emph default
.
 The Consumer Flows can have 
\emph on
Filters
\emph default
 configured.
 A default message type filter can be configured using the "msgFilter" attribute
 on the 
\emph on
Consumer Flow
\emph default
 in which case only the message types specified in the comma separated list
 will be relayed.
 If more complex filtering is required then a custom 
\emph on
Filter
\emph default
 can be configured.
 The class implementing the 
\emph on
Filter
\emph default
 functionality must implement 
\series bold
com.marvisan.hades.fix.engine.process.stream.Filter
\series default
 interface.
 The 
\emph on
Consumer Flow
\emph default
 "msgFilterClass" attribute configures a custom filter for the flow.
 If N 
\emph on
Consumer Flows
\emph default
 are configured in a 
\emph on
Stream
\emph default
 then at least N - 1 
\emph on
Filters
\emph default
 must be specified otherwise all the messages will be consumed by the first
 flow configured.
 If a message is filtered then it will be passed to the next flow configured
 or discarded if no 
\emph on
Consumer Flow
\emph default
 exists.
 The 
\emph on
Consumer Flows
\emph default
 are running in the Consumer Stream thread.

\begin_layout Section
Client/Server Handlers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The messages received by the 
\emph on
Consumer Flow
\emph default
 from their
\emph on
 Consumer Stream
\emph default
 are relayed to the chain of custom message 
\emph on
Handlers
\emph default
.
 Handlers are the customization points of the engine.
 The Handlers are created for the purpose of processing incoming FIX messages
 and deliver them to the business layer.
 The last 
\emph on
Handler
\emph default
 in the configured chain is the pivot 
\emph on
Handler
\emph default
 and it is responsible with the delivery of the message to the 
\emph on
Application Layer
\emph default
 using whatever chosen technology.
 Any 
\emph on
Handler
\emph default
 in the chain can discard the received message if required.
 If the message is discarded by a 
\emph on
Handler
\emph default
 in the chain, the subsequent Handler will not receive the message and the
 message will not be delivered to the 
\emph on
Application Layer
\emph default
.
 The 
\emph on
Handlers
\emph default
 configured in the 
\emph on
Consumer Flows
\emph default
 are running in the 
\emph on
Consumer Stream
\emph default
 thread.

 and deliver them to the counter-party via the fix session.
 The 
\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are 3 types of custom Handlers that can be developed: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Consumer Handler that needs to extend 
\series bold
com.marvisan.hades.fix.engine.handler.AbstractConsumerHandler
\series default
 class.
 This handler types can only be configured inside a 
\emph on
Consumer Flow
\emph default
 and must override the "consume" method.
 A 
\emph on
Consumer Handler
\emph default
 implementation will have an instance created inside the 
\emph on
Consumer Stream
\emph default
 thread and will be able to create its own threads.
 The 
\emph on
Handler
\emph default
 implementation is responsible for managing its own created threads.
 In order for the processed message to be forwarded to the next message
 in chain the "super.consume()" method must be called before exiting the
 "consume" method, otherwise the message will be discarded.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Producer Handler that needs to extend 
\series bold
com.marvisan.hades.fix.engine.handler.AbstractProducerHandler
\series default
 class.
 This handler types can only be configured inside a 
\emph on
Producer Flow
\emph default
 and must override the "produce" method.
 A 
\emph on
Producer Handler
\emph default
 implementation will have an instance created inside the 
\emph on
Producer Stream
\emph default
 thread and will be able to create its own threads.
 The 
\emph on
Handler
\emph default
 implementation is responsible for managing the created threads.
 In order for the processed message to be forwarded to the next message
 in chain the "super.produce()" method must be called before exiting the
 "produce" method, otherwise the message will be discarded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Producer/Consumer Handler that needs to extend 
\series bold
com.marvisan.hades.fix.engine.handler.AbstractProducerConsumerHandler
\series default
 class.
 This handler types can be configured in both Producer and Consumer Flows.
 The handlers will have a shared instance created in the Session Coordinator
 thread that will be called by the Consumer and Producer Flows.
 Thread safety must be taken care of for this handler type implementation
 as different threads will call the "consume" and "produce" methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Event Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HadesFIX component are reporting/consuming 
\series bold
alerts
\series default
 and 
\series bold
life cycle
\series default
 events.
 These events are relayed to the parent components: Handlers, Flows, Streams,
 Session Coordinator, Hades Instance.
 A graphical representation of the event model is depicted bellow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename EventModel.png
	groupId UserGuide

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Life Cycle events are reported by all the components and are used internally
 by the engine.
 A Handler can subscribe to this type of events by registering with the
 Session Coordinator - 
\emph on
attachAsLifeCycleEventListener()
\series bold
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Handler can also receive FIX protocol level messages (Login, Logout,...)
 by registering with the Session Coordinator - 
\emph on
attachAsMessageEventListener().
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Handlers can only generate Alert messages which are relayed to the Session
 Coordinator and Hades Instance - 
\emph on
sendAlertEvent(AlertEvent event).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Part
FIX Engine Configuration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Setting up engine configuration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Prerequisites
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hades engine is highly configurable.
 All the configuration for a Hades instance - Java process - is hold in
 a configuration file.
 This configuration file must be specified as a java environment parameter
 in the script file that starts the engine.
 The parameter name is 
\emph on
hades.engine.config.file.

\emph default
 This parameter must contain the full OS path of the file.
 The directory where this file is placed is considered as a base for all
 the other configuration data needed.
 The configuration file is a XML file.
 Its schema is placed in the distribution archive in the 
\series bold
docs/schema
\series default
 folder and it is named 
\emph on
HadesEngineConfig.xsd
\emph default
.
 You will be able to validate your configuration using this XML schema file.
 The engine itself is doing the same thing when it starts up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A HadesFIX engine can run multiple FIX sessions at a time, either client
 or server, for each counter-party and each of them having its own FIX version.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Secured messages and handler definitions can be specified at the engine,
 counter-party and session level.
 The settings at the counter-party level will override the settings at the
 engine level if using the same names.
 The same happens with the settings at the session level that will override
 the counter-party and engine level settings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
HadesFIX engine instance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The configuration of the engine is specified as attributes of the
\emph on
 <hadesInstance>
\emph default

 The configuration for a counter-party consists of the FIX counter-party
 identification fields: 
\emph on
compID
\emph default
, 
\emph on

\emph default
 and 
\emph on
locationID
\emph default
.
 Form these 3 the only required one is the

 for the sell side.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
TCP connection configuration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The server or client TCP connection data required fields by the HadesFIX
 engine are the 
\emph on
host
\emph default
 and 
\emph on

\emph default
 element.
 For a server connection if 
\emph on
host
\emph default
 is specified then it must be the local bind address (hosts with multiple
 addresses).
 The other configuration attributes are optional and have default values.
 The optional configuration parameters set at the 
\emph on
tcpConnection
\emph default
 element level are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
soLinger - if greater than 0 this option sets the time in seconds the socket
 close() method will wait for delivery of remaining packets before shutting
 down the connection.
 By default the close() method returns immediately and if soLinger is set
 to 0 all the remaining packets will be discarded.
 Defaults to the specific platform value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
tcpNodelay - this is a flag that if set to true disables buffering at the
 socket level ensuring that the packets are sent to the destination as soon
 as they are delivered to the socket regardless of their size.
 In the normal scenario the small packets are combined into large packets
 before being sent.
 The Nagle algorithm used when tcpNodely is disabled waits for a confirmation
 from the remote host before sending another packet.
 This might hamper the steady transfer of data between the client and the
 server.
 Defaults to false.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
rxBufferSize - this sets the size of the received messages buffer.

soTimeout - used to tune how many milliseconds the read method blocks waiting
 for data.
 Default value is 3 milliseconds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
soRcvbuf - size in bytes of the receive buffer.
 Platform specific.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
soSndbuf - size in bytes of the transmission buffer.

keyStoreLoc 
\emph default
is always relative to the configuration directory - the directory where
 the instance configuration file is placed.
 If 
\emph on
useCliAuth 
\emph default
is set to true (default to false) then the truststore location 
\emph on
trustStoreLoc
\emph default
 together with the trust-store password 
\emph on
trustStorePasswd
\emph default
 are required.
 If the key password 
\emph on
keyPasswd
\emph default
 is not given it will default to 
\emph on

connectOnStartup - the Session Coordinator will attempt to initiate a connection
 with the counter-party when it is started.
 Defaults to "true".

FIX Object Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 For simplicity only the NewOrderSingleMsg class is shown.
 All the FIX messages are inheriting from the FIXMsg class ad has to implement
 a contract in order to be encoded and decoded.

Message creation is using factories.
 Obtaining a new message is a matter of calling:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

NewOrderSingleMsg msg = (NewOrderSingleMsg) FIXMsgBuilder.build(MsgType.NewOrderSi
ngle.getValue(), BeginString.FIX_4_4);
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The call will create a NewOrderSingle FIX message for the FIX version 4.4.
 The Components and Groups for this release will not be pre-populated.
 It is the responsibility of the user to populate them.
 After the object is populate calling the 
\emph on
encode()
\emph default
 method on the message will return a byte array representation of the FIX
 message.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Obtaining an Object message from the FIX encoded byte array can be obtain
 from the same factory by calling:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings

\begin_layout Plain Layout

NewOrderSingleMsg dmsg = (NewOrderSingleMsg) FIXMsgBuilder.build(byte[] fixMsg);
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only the header fields will be decoded.
 In order to have all the message decoded the 
\emph on

\begin_layout Standard
HadesFIX allows for the extension of the FIX model in order to cater for
 custom tags and custom messages.
 The mechanism used to extend the custom tags and messages is presented
 bellow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Custom tags and message handling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Custom tags are supported in two ways.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The first method is to use the Map of custom messages that is contained
 in the 
\series bold
com.marvisan.hades.fix.message.FIXMsg
\series default
 super-class.
 This class has methods to add, retrieve and remove custom tags from the
 message custom map.
 The 
\emph on
getCustomTag, addCustomTag, removeCustomTag 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
clearCustomTags 
\emph default
methods (see javadoc) can be used to manage the custom tags set for encoding
 or decoded.
 The limitation of this methods is that all the custom tags values must
 be represented as a java.lang.String class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The second method is overwriting the HadesFIX message implementation and
 adding to the extended message all the custom tags, groups and components
 required.
 The overriding mechanism requires, apart of the overriding class message
 implementation, the writing of a custom message factory class which must
 be configured in a property file.
 This is also the mechanism used to create custom messages.
 The next section describes how to extend or write a new FIX message.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Writing a custom message
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Writing a custom new message requires the following steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Create a new message class that extends 
\series bold
com.marvisan.hades.fix.message.FIXMsg
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All HadesFIX messages are extending 
\series bold
com.marvisan.hades.fix.message.FIXMsg 
\series default
class that in its turns extends the 
\series bold
com.marvisan.hades.fix.message.Fragment
\series default
 class.
 The abstract interface is defined in the Fragment class (see javadoc for
 further explanations).
 The contracts defined by the Fragment class contains
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
methods that return the FIX tags in the message/component/group : 
\emph on
getFragmentTags(), getFragmentAllTags(), getFragmentDataTags(), getFragmentCompT
ags(), getFragmentSecuredTags()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
method to validate a FIX message/component/group:
\emph on
 validateRequiredTags() throws TagNotPresentException
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
methods to set the tag value when the FIX message/component/group is decoded
 from the byte array: 
\emph on
setFragmentTagValue(Tag tag), setFragmentCompTagValue(Tag tag, ByteBuffer
 message), setFragmentDataTagValue(Tag tag, ByteBuffer message)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
methods to encode the FIX object message/component/group in a wire FIX message:
 
\emph on
encodeFragmentAll(), encodeFragmentSecured(boolean secured)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When extending an existing message these methods might need to be implemented.
 If pre FIX4.4 version message encryption is used then the appropriate secured
 related methods need to be implemented too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Create enclosed components and groups
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Component classes need to extend the abstract 
\series bold
com.marvisan.hades.fix.message.component.Component 
\series default
class.
 this class extends also the Fragment class and must satisfy the contract
 defined by this class.
 Further the Component class define a supplementary interface method 
\emph on
getFirstTag() 
\emph default
that needs to return the first tag in a repeating component/group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Repeating groups need to extend the 
\series bold
com.marvisan.hades.fix.message.group.Group 
\series default
class.
 Group class extends the Component class and has the same contract to be
 fulfilled.
 The subtle difference between the two sits only in the fact that a component
 might not be and by the FIX protocol standard allows the fields in the
 component to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

scattered
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 all over the message.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Create a custom factory class
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HadesFIX messages are encoded/decoded using a generic message factory 
\series bold
com.marvisan.hades.fix.message.builder.FIXMsgBuilder
\series default
.
 The generic message factory uses message builders for each of the FIX messages.
 A FIX message builder class must extend 
\series bold
com.marvisan.hades.fix.message.builder.MsgBuilder
\series default
 class and implement the abstract interface defined by that class.
 The method to implement are 
\emph on
build(MsgVersionType msgType, byte[] message)
\emph default
 for decoding a message and 
\emph on
build(BeginString version, ApplVerID applVerID)
\emph default
 for building an empty FIX message used for encoding.
 Please bear in mind that the message builder class must be thread safe.
 See javadoc for supplementary information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Make the class visible to the FIXMsgBuilder
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FIXMsgBuilder class can be configured at run-time or using a configuration
 file placed in the root classspath named 
\emph on
HadesMsgBuilderClasses.properties.
 
\emph default
An example of message builder configuration would be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

# Example HadesMsgBuilderClasses.properties file (see samples)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

AZ=com.marvisan.hades.fix.sample.message.builder.CustomNewMessageBuilder
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This file contains entries made from the message type and the message builder
 implementation class that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to have multiple 
\emph on
HadesMsgBuilderClasses.properties
\emph default
 files placed in different locations.
 In order for this files to be recognized by the run-time a System property
 named 
\series bold
hades.model.build.file.location
\series default
 must be set.
 This property contains a colon separated list of packages that contain
 the custom message builder config file 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
E.g.
 -Dhades.model.build.file.location=com.marvisan.hades.fix.sample.builder1:com.marvisan.hade
s.fix.sample.builder2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The files must contain builders for different messages as the later loaded
 files will override the previous settings obviously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FIXMsgBuilder can also be setup at run-time using the following methods:
 
\emph on
addMsgBuilder(String msgType, MsgBuilder builder), addMsgBuilders(Map<String,
 MsgBuilder> builders), 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
clearMsgBuilder(String msgType).
 
\emph default
See javadoc for further information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Add JAXB annotations to the class (only if FIXML support is required)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FIXML support in 
\series bold
HadesFIX
\series default
 is done using JAXB.
 The class message together with enclosed components and group must be annotated
 in order to have XML generated.
 At this point schema validation of the messages for inbound/outbound messages
 is supported.
 Schema validation is done using standard FIXML schema files which are stored
 in FIXMLSchema.jar.
 In order to be able to validate your messages you need to add your custom
 message schema data to the existing FIXML schema files.
 The sample message 
\series bold
com.marvisan.hades.fix.sample.message.CustomNewMsg
\series default
 offer a good starting point for using annotations to create custom FIXML
 messages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Make the packages holding messages/components/groups visible to the FIXMLBuilder
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is done by using a configuration file placed in the root classspath
 named 
\emph on
HadesJAXBPackages.properties.
 
\emph default
The format of this file has as a key the 
\emph on
ApplVerID
\emph default
 number and the value is the colon separated list of packages containing
 the classes part of the FIXML message.
 An example file would look like:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

# File entries format is ApplVerId=colon separated packages

\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Writing a Handler
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order for the HadesFIX engine to work it will need custom message handlers
 to be written.
 The class diagram for HadesFIX handlers is depicted bellow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename Handler.png
	groupId UserGuide

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of the 3 types of Handlers: Consumer, Producer and ConsumerProducer
 have corresponding Abstract classes from which they must inherit.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The life cycle of the Handler is controlled by the engine.
 There are 3 methods that are called by the engine.
 At the creation time the default constructor is used to create the Handler.
 Immediatelly after the Flow calls the 
\series bold
init()
\series default
 method.
 If custom 
\lang british
initialisation
\lang english
 is necessary then the 
\series bold
init()
\series default
 method can be overwritten with the custom implementation.
 When the session is closed the 
\series bold
close()
\series default
 method is called and if needed the method can be overwritten.
 The default implementations of these 2 methods do nothing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third method is the most important one and must be overwritten: 
\series bold
consume()
\series default
 for a Consumer Handler, 
\series bold
produce()
\series default
 for a Producer Handler and both 
\series bold
consume() and produce()
\series default
 for a ConsumerProducer Handler.
 This methods are called by the engine every time a message is relayed through
 the Handlers chain.
 The custom implementation must call the super-class same method if the
 message is to be passed to the next handler in chain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the Handler needs to receive engine Life Cycle events or protocol messages
 then the handler must register itself with the Session Coordinator by calling
 
\emph on
attachAsLifeCycleEventListener() / attachAsMessageEventListener().
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Handler can send alerts to the Session Coordinator by calling 
\emph on
sendAlertEvent()
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Configured parameters are retrieved by using 
\emph on
getParameters()
\emph default
 method that returns a Map populated with the Handler parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Handler can be temporarily disabled.
 A disabled Handler is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

skipped
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the message is passed to the next Handler in chain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a received message needs to be rejected at the FIX session level then
 the Handler must throw a 
\series bold
com.marvisan.hades.fix.engine.exception.HandlerException
\series default
 exception.
 The exception message text will fill the 
\emph on
Text
\emph default
 field in the FIX Reject message.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
FIXML Support
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HadesFIX supports FIXML starting with FIX version 4.4.
 FIXML encoding/decoding is done at this point using JAXB.
 In order for a FIX message to be encoded in FIXML the
\emph on
 toFixml()
\emph default
 method must be called on the FIX message.
 The method will return the FIXML message representation of the FIX message
 as a String object.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To decode a FIXML message 
\emph on
fromFixml()
\emph default
 method must be called of the FIX message.
 It is assumed that the message type is the same as the FIXML message string
 passed as a parameter.
 In order to improve performance the FixmlCoded instance is stored in the
 
\emph on
ThreadLocal
\emph default
 context.
 The FIXML encoding/decoding options (validation, error behavior, XML printable
 format) are in this case set using the 
\emph on
SessionContext
\emph default
 thread local object.
 (See javadoc for 
\series bold
com.marvisan.hades.fix.message.config.SessionContext
\series default
 and 
\series bold
com.marvisan.hades.fix.message.config.SessionContextKey
\series default
 classes ).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another way of creating FIXML messages is to use the 
\emph on
FixmlCodec
\emph default
 class directly (see 
\series bold
com.marvisan.hades.fix.message.xml.codec.FixmlCodec
\series default
 interface javadoc).
 To obtain a code instance it is easy, all you need is: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ServiceLoader<FixmlCodec> codec = ServiceLoader.load(FixmlCodec.class);
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case you will need to cache yourself the 
\emph on
FixmlCodec
\emph default
 instance and set the desired encoding/decoding parameters.
 The FixmlCodec implementation is thread safe.
 In order to encode a message you will need to call the 
\emph on
marshall() 
\emph default
method passing the FIX message as parameter.
 The returned String object will contain the FIXML message.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To decode a message call the
\emph on
 unmarshall()
\emph default
 method.
 The first parameter is the FIXML String object.
 The second parameter is the FIX message and it is optional.
 If the second parameter is provided then the message object will have the
 values populated from the FIXML data and returned as result.
 If second parameters is set to null then this method will create a new
 FIX message object and populate it with the FIXML data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
AN example of FIX message supporting XML can be found in distribution 
\series bold
sample
\series default
 directory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Batch messages support is achieved by using a surrogate FIX message : 
\series bold
com.marvisan.hades.fix.message.BatchSetMsg
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This message class can only be used in a FIXML context.
 FIX encoding/decoding of this message will fail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Obtaining an instance of the class for a specific FIX version is done as
 per normal:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

BatchSetMsg batchSet = (BatchSetMsg) FIXMsgBuilder.build(MsgType.BatchSet.getValue(
), BeginString.FIX_4_4);
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
BatchSetMsg is a wrapper for a collection of Batch objects.
 Batch objects are modeled as FIX components (see 
\series bold
com.marvisan.hades.fix.message.comp.Batch
\series default
).
 Batch component contains a collection of FIX messages and an optional Header
 for the containing messages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After populating the BatchSet message with Batch components encoding to
 FIXM/decoding from FIXML uses the same mechanism as described above.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Scheduler
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The HadesFIX scheduler runs in the same process as the engine and only manages
 of the instance is running in.
 Scheduled tasks can be configured at the instance and session level.
 The scheduler is activated when an entry is present in the configuration
 file at the instance level (see configuration schema for details): 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<scheduler> 	
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	<calendars />      
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

</scheduler>
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The configuration above enable the scheduler only.
 In order to have date exclusions calendar entries are required.
 A calendar entry allows the definition of a set of dates that will disable
 the execution of tasks that refers that calendar entry.
 An example of calendar exclusion is shown bellow: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<calendars>

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	</calendar>          
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

</calendars>
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Calendar name attribute is required and will be referenced from the schedule
 task configuration if needed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A schedule task can be defined at the instance and session level.
 If the task is defined at the instance level and the task operates on a
 session then extra parameters are required in order to identify the session
 it will operate on.
 An example schedule set of tasks defined at the instance level is presented
 bellow: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	</calendars> 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

</tasks>
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course the task parameters for STOP_SESSION schedule are not required
 if the task would have been defined at the session level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A task definition has a required name.
 The name must be unique across all the engine tasks.
 Task type is one of the following key words: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
start - starts a stopped (shutdown) session 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
stop - stops a running session and destroys all the memory structures for
 that session
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
freeze - freezes an active session thaw - 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
thaws an already frozen session connect - 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
connects the transport of an initiator (buy side) session that was previously
 disconnected 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
disconnect - disconnects the transport of a session 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
reset - resets the expected sequence numbers of a session to 1.
 Sends a Logon message with ResetSeqNumFlag field set to true to the counter-par
ty 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
shutdown - shuts down the HadesFIX instance gracefully 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The task parameters names are at this point the following values: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
cptyAddress - counter-party address in the format compID.subID.LocationID
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
sessAddress - session address in the format compID.subID.LocationID 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Part
Utilities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Password Bank Utility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Password Bank utility is used by the HadesFIX engine as an encrypted
 password store.
 All the passwords used in configuring the engine are stored in this password
 container and referenced by an entry name.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The utility application that manages the password store is located in the
 bin directory and can be run by typing passwdbank.cmd/passwdbank.sh in a
 command shell window.
 The 
\series bold
pwdbank>
\series default
 prompt shell is displayed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use 
\series bold
help
\series default
 command to get all the available commands and 
\series bold
help <command_name>
\series default
 for help regarding a specific command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the first steps in setting up the HadesFIX engine is to create a
 password bank file.
 This is achieved by using the Password Bank application 
\emph on
new
\emph default
 command.
 The 
\emph on
new
\emph default
 command will create a new password bank file named 
\series bold
password.bank
\series default
 which will be saved in the same directory where the passwdbank command/shell
 is run.
 This file must be placed in the same directory where the Hades engine configura
tion file is located.
 
\emph on
Do not change the name of the file
\emph default
!!! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If an existing file password bank file exists it will be backed up in a
 file with extension yyyymmddhhmmss.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adding an entry to the password bank is a matter of running the 
\emph on
add
\emph default
 command.
 E.g.
 
\series bold
add test password
\series default
 This will create an entry with the name test and the password set as password.
 From now on the HadesFIX config file the password will be referenced by
 the entry name.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To list all the entries in the password store the list command can be used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To check a password bank entry the check command can be used.
 E.g 
\series bold
check test password
\series default
 will return "Matches the store value" message if the password value matches.
 The message returned for a password that does not match the password bank
 password is "Does not match the store value".
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Removing a password from the password bank is done by running the remove
 command.
 E.g 
\series bold
remove test
\series default
 will remove the password with the password bank entry name test.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Management Console Application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The management console application allows the management of multiple HadesFIX
 instances.
 It also provides one point entry screen able to display the alerts generated
 by all the managed engines.
 Configuration data is saved in a file that can be made known to the application
 by specifying it using a java environment entry passed on the command line:
 -Dhades.engine.config.file=PATH_TO_YOUR_CONFIG_FILE.
 If the environment entry is not specified then the application will create
 a configuration file named: 
\emph on
HadesAdminConfig.xml
\emph default
 and it will place this file in the directory where the Management Console
 has been started.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
